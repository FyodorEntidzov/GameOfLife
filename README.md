# GameOfLife

Game of Life was created by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It consists of a number of cells, each can be in one of two states:dead or alive. The following rules are used to determine whether cell is dead or alive:

1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Set up starting state by clicking on a cell. This will change its state. Then click "Start" to see how the system develops.
